### **Project Overview**

**This is a showcase project intended for demonstration purposes only.** It is not recommended for production use.

This repository contains a multi-container Docker project with the following components:

* **Worker:** Handles background tasks or computations.
* **Server:** Acts as the central hub for communication between the client and worker.
* **Client:** Interacts with the user, sends requests to the server, and receives responses.
* **Nginx:** Serves as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and web server.

### **Important Note**

**Do not clone or use this project in a production environment.** It is designed to illustrate concepts and best practices, but it lacks the necessary robustness, security, and scalability for real-world applications.

### **Getting Started (Demonstration Only)**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. **Build and Run Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### **Continuous Integration (CI) Setup (Demonstration Only)**

**[Replace with your CI/CD pipeline configuration]**

This project utilizes [CI/CD tool] to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Build:** Builds the Docker images for each container.
2. **Test:** Runs unit tests and integration tests.
3. **Push:** Pushes the built images to Docker Hub.
4. **Deploy:** Deploys the application to AWS Beanstalk.

### **Docker Compose Configuration (Demonstration Only)**

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services and their dependencies:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  worker:
    build: ./worker
    environment:
      - WORKER_ENV=production
  server:
    build: ./server
    environment:
      - SERVER_ENV=production
  client:
    build: ./client
    environment:
      - CLIENT_ENV=production
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

### **Additional Notes (Demonstration Only)**

* **Environment Variables:** Adjust the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file to match your specific configuration.
* **Networking:** Configure the network settings in `docker-compose.yml` to suit your requirements.
* **AWS Beanstalk:** Refer to the AWS documentation for detailed instructions on deploying to Beanstalk.
